# GITHUB REPO LIST

Welcome to my project where you will be seeing a way to list down the repository for an organization as well branches for the repo.

For this project I used React + Typescript Framework. The reason for choosing React is, it is very clean, easy to build javascript framework with lot of support and performance wise as well and its latest feature React Hooks is a very big hit.

Typescript is used here as to ensure type safety which is far more important than the development itself

Concerning the unit-testing, jest with react-testing-utils is used and we have implemented only for one component which is Selector - src/Selector/

MaterialUI is used for input fields and React Table is used for displaying the table information.
